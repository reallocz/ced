Johannes Kepler (/ˈkɛplər/;[1] German: [joˈhanəs ˈkɛplɐ]; December 27, 1571 – November 15, 1630)
was a German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer.

Kepler is a key figure in the 17th-century scientific revolution.
He is best known for his laws of planetary motion, based on his works Astronomia nova,
Harmonices Mundi, and Epitome of Copernican Astronomy. These works also provided one of the 
foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation.

Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz, where he became an associate of
Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. Later he became an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe in 
Prague, and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors 
Matthias and Ferdinand II. He also taught mathematics in Linz, and was an adviser to General Wallenstein.
Additionally, he did fundamental work in the field of optics, invented an improved version 
of the refracting telescope (the Keplerian telescope), and was mentioned in the telescopic discoveries 
of his contemporary Galileo Galilei. He was a corresponding member of the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome.[2]

Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology,
but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts) and
physics (a branch of natural philosophy). Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and 
reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had 
created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason.
[3] Kepler described his new astronomy as "celestial physics",[4] as "an excursion into Aristotle's Metaphysics"
,[5] and as "a supplement to Aristotle's On the Heavens",[6] transforming the ancient tradition of physical
 cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.[7]
